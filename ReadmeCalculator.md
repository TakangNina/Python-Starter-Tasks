## How to Use

1. Click the number buttons to input numbers.
2. Click the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to input operations.
3. Click the '=' button to calculate the result.
4. Click 'Clear' to reset the input field.

## Limitations

- This calculator uses Python's `eval()` function, which can be unsafe if used with user input in a production environment. This implementation is for learning purposes only.
- The calculator does not handle complex mathematical expressions or functions.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced operations (square root, exponents, etc.)
- Implement order of operations without using `eval()`
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Enhance the GUI design
