Sure, here's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in Python3 with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a README file for a GitHub repository:
Rock Paper Scissors GUI in Python3
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python3 using the Tkinter library for the GUI.
Getting Started
To run the game, you'll need to have Python3 and the Tkinter library installed. Tkinter is a standard library in Python3, so you shouldn't need to install anything extra.
Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors-gui.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copycd rock-paper-scissors-gui

Run the game:

Copypython3 rock_paper_scissors.py
How to Play

The game will open a window with three buttons: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
Click on one of the buttons to make your choice.
The computer will randomly choose its move.
The game will display the result (win, lose, or tie) and update the score.
To play again, simply click one of the buttons.

Code Explanation
The code is divided into the following parts:

Imports: We import the necessary modules, including Tkinter for the GUI.
Game Logic: The game logic is implemented in the play_game() function, which takes the user's choice and the computer's choice, and determines the winner.
GUI Setup: The GUI is set up using Tkinter, with three buttons for the user's choices and labels to display the result and the score.
Main Loop: The main game loop runs, handling user input and updating the display.
