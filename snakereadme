Here's a simple Snake Game implemented in Python with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The GUI colors are set to pink and white.
Snake Game in Python3 with GUI
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python3 and the Tkinter library for the GUI.
Getting Started
To run the game, you'll need to have Python3 and the Tkinter library installed. Tkinter is a standard library in Python3, so you shouldn't need to install anything extra.
Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-gui.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copycd snake-game-gui

Run the game:

Copypython3 snake_game.py
How to Play

The game window will open, displaying a pink and white grid.
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
The snake will start moving, and you need to guide it to eat the food (represented by a small square) that appears randomly on the grid.
Every time the snake eats the food, its length increases, and the score is updated.
If the snake hits the wall or its own body, the game is over.
The game will display the final score when you lose.
To play again, simply restart the script.

Code Explanation
The code is divided into the following parts:

Imports: We import the necessary modules, including Tkinter for the GUI.
Game Setup: We set up the game window, the grid, and the initial snake and food positions.
Game Logic: The main game logic is implemented in the move_snake() function, which updates the snake's position and checks for collisions.
User Input: We bind the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
Game Loop: The main game loop runs, updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, and redrawing the game elements.
